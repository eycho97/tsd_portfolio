## Sparkline Graphs for Government Debt
Used Flourish to create sparkline-style graphs to visualize the GDP debt ratio across different countries and years (1995-2020).

### Reflection
For my second data visualization, I decided to make a heatmap of the different countries and their debt-to-GDP ratios across the years (took inspiration from the optional Tableu part). The "sparkline" grid of line charts and the heatmap are similar in that they are able to communicate a view of how multiple countries are performing across the same timespan. However, they differ in how they can be used to communicate different messages. The sprakline graphs show the progression of each country's debt-to-GDP ratio in a bird's eye view, whereas the heatmap shows a more direct comparison through the use of color indicating how high or low a country's debt-to-GDP ratio is. I thought that this was a more effective way to bring attention to certain countries (Japan and Greece) that had particularly high ratios, which might not have been as noticeable in the grid of line charts visualization.

When designing the heatmap visualization, one area of concern was the color to represent the different ratio values. Initially I thought the Red/Yellow/Green option would be best to indicate countries that were in trouble (red - high ratio) and countries that were doing well (green - low ratio). Although I thought these colors were better suited, I chose to go with a Red/Yellow/Blue option for those that might have red/green color blindness. I thought the contrast between red and blue were also sufficent to represent high and low ratio values. I also struggled with sorting the values in the heatmap (couldn't find an option to do so in Flourish). Therefore, I manually reordered the data so Japan and Greece would appear on the top, to help accentuate the point I was trying to make with the heatmap.

Source Information - OECD General Government Debt https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm
This data shows the ratio between the gross debt of a country with its reported GDP. The data spans from 1995-2020. Note that not all countries listed report their data every year, so there may be missing data.
