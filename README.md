# Edward Cho Portfolio
My portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
My name is Edward Cho and I use he/him pronouns. I am a second year student in the Master of Information Systems Management program at Heinz. I also completed my undergraduate degree at CMU, majoring in Information Systems and Human Computer Inteaction. After graduating in May, I will be working as a software developer in New York. In my free time, I like to play various sports like basketball and tennis. I've also developed a lot of interest in cooking recently.

# What I hope to learn
Although I have a background in HCI, I don't have too much experience with applying design principles to data. I believe that even the most high quality data can be useless without effective communication, so I look forward to learn how to develop data visualizations that tell a story. In my past internship, there were several instances where I needed to use data visualizations to make a point in my final presentation. This will probably be the case for most presentations throughout the rest of my career, so it is a skill I'm excited to improve on.
