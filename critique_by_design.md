#Assignment 3 - Critique By Design

In this assignment, I searched for a visualization that could use improvment and critiqued it.
Then, I created some sketches to start the improvement process and tested the sketches to receive constructive feedback.

###Step 1: Find a Data Visualization
For this assignment, I found a visualization on batting averages for different cities in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
The visualization captured my eye because of the unique representation of data through city monuments. The source of the visuaization can be found on this [website](https://runrepeat.com/your-city-cricket-world-cup-rankings)
