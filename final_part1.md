# Final Project: Part 1

## Outline
Through the final project I plan to explore the topic of lack of sleep for high schoolers and Pennsylvania (and the US in general).
I want to discuss the health implications for those lacking in sleep and the current trends for high school student sleep patterns. 
Finally, I want to suggest solutions that have worked so far, and what we can do to improve the sleep habits for students.

### Project Structure
<strong>Introduction:</strong>
I want to start the introduction by talking about my experiences as a middle and high school student.
This will serve as a hook to get the audience interested in the topic, as I discuss how I had to wake up at 6am after a groggy night of sleep to catch the school bus and start the day half-asleep.

<strong>Basic Sleep Stasticis:</strong>
I will use this section to cover basic sleep statistics. This includes recommended number of hours for sleep at different age ranges, as well as health-related consequences that come with the lack of sleep.

<strong>High School Sleep Patterns:</strong>
Once I cover the basic statistics, I will dive into high school student sleep patterns, and show that they are on a downward trend - Pennsylvania being one of the worse states. To add on to this, I will show visualizations of how different levels of lack of sleep affects activities specific for high school students.

<strong>Possible Solutions:</strong>
Here, I will discuss a relatively simple solution to this problem - delaying the school start time. There are schools in different cities that have implemented this and have seen improvements, so I plan to show visualizations that demonstrate this point.

<strong>Conclusion - Call to Action:</strong>
Finally, I will have a call to action to urge the viewers to pressure the Pennsylvania (or Pittsburgh) government to change the local school start times. I will need to find more details on how this might be possible.

## Data
[America's Health Rankings - Insufficient Sleep](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/sleep/state/PA)
[CDC - Sleep Requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html)
- I will use this data to visualize how much sleep is recommended for different age groups, highlighting high schoolers.
[CDC - Risk Factors & Health Conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html)
- I will use the several sources provided on this page to visualize how Pennsylvania is doing compared to the rest of the country, and provide vizualizations of the consequences of the lack of sleep on our health.
[HealthyPeople - PA Student Sleep](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/data/Chart/5260?category=1&by=Total&fips=-1)
- I will use this data to compare sleep trends for high schoolers in PA and the average for the US.
[CDC - Sleep Duration & Injury](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6513a1.htm#T1_down)
- I will use this data to visualize how lack of sleep can lead to various injuries
[CDC - Teeneager Mortality](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db37.htm)
[ScienceAdvances - Later Start Times](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aau6200)
- I will use this data in my solution section to show how later start times can improve sleep and performance for students.
[Unniversity of Minnesoty - GPA Boost](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/219373)
- Shows how later start times resulted in increased GPA



## Method and Medium
I will build my final project using the shorthand platform demonstrated in class.
In the next phases of the project, I will create a mood board that defines the aesthetic of the shorthand webiste and fits in with the message I intend to tell with my data visualizations.
I will create easy-to-read data visualizations and complementary text to guid the viewers through a compelling story.
