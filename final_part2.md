# Final Project: Part 2

## Wireframe
I used storyboard to develop my wireframe, and the link can be found here: [Storyboard Wireframe](https://preview.shorthand.com/fQ3Cofl65tsBUXhS)

## User Research and Interviews

### Target Audience
The audience I hoped to reach to are current high school students, school administrators and parents. Sleep has an impact on all of us, but I believe focusing on the needs of high school students can capture the attention of several groups that can affect change (parent organizations, and school administrators). I plan on giving two types of calls to action: 1. A call to action for more systematic changes to request later start times (petitions) 2. Things students can do right now to help with their current sleeping habits. 

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Due to limited time, I couldn't find interviewees that fit my exact target audiences. However, I contacted two college students who can still relate to the struggles of school and sleep and represent the concerns of high school students. I also contacted a person who hopes to be a parent soon and can relate to the concerns parents of high school students might have.

### Interview Script
Today I will be asking you to give feedback on my Telling Stories with Data project on the case for starting high school an hour later. As you go through the proejct, please talk out loud about your first impressions and anything that confuses you or doesn't make sense. Then, I will go through a series of questions to gather further feedback from you.

(The questions can be seen in the first column of the Interview Findings section below)

### Interview Findings

| Question | Tech Professional, Female, 30s | Grad Student, Male, 20s | College Grad, Female 20s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What are your main takeaway(s) from this piece? | More sleep is better, trying to argue that later start times would help with that. However, it doesn’t feel like enough (telling the story the way you want it to be told). What are the other causes of not sleeping enough? (problem with the premise) | I need more sleep, and school needs to start later. Sleep is more important than I thought and I need more sleep. | More beneficial for students to start school later. It’s good to have a healthy sleep schedule. |
| Is there anything surprising or confusing? | Not really - data sources start consistent but become varied as it gets closer to the solution. Surprised it took time to go under the average. | Surprised about that having less sleep leads to injury risk behavior specifically. Could be common sense but surprised to see the statistics. | Interested and surprised by the data - specifically the last two visualizations that show improvement after starting late. A little skeptical - other variables? Was sleep the only factor? |
| What additional information would you like to see? | What would the attacks to your study be, how would you combat or disprove those? Does later start time correlate to more sleep? Does it help with other behaviors? | Data that directly shows school that start later result in student sleep increasing | Sample size for solution, context into the institutions that carried out research (summary of experiment). Add academic-related data visualization in lack of sleep. |
| How did the story flow? Would you reorder any of the sections? | Flow is fine - need to add in sections around your approach (methodologies and approach, why are students not sleeping enough?, alternatives, details of experiment) | Introduction - for a more persuasive narrative could be removed (distracts from the story - unless I can communicate GPA in relation) | Like how you started with personal story, but too casual. Mention source of data (device) |
| Are the data visualizations clear? If not, what would you change? | Recommend sleep (how much they are getting vs. recommended) Insufficient sleep (confusing) Absences (pretty clear) | Very clear. PA sleep graph needs more comparison points. | Recommended hour of sleep graph (make x axis label (age range) more visible, Why is it important to show all the other age ranges?). Transition - too forced. Diversify graph formats if possible |
| Who do you think the intended audience is | General population - educational, until you get to the call to help section.  | Could be a pamphlet for policy makers, teacher union | Policy makers, general public |

### Common Feedback
- I received feedback that the wording (especially in PA) when showing the high school sleep decreasing in Pennsylvania was misleading. I should either compare it with data from other states, or change the wording.
- The interviewees thought the flow of the narrative made sense and that the format was compelling.
- They wanted to see other data - "Are there other reasons why high school students aren't getting sleep? It can't just be the late start times".
- It was not clear what the percentages indicated in the graph on chronic health conditions
- It would be helpful to add more images or iconography along with the data and text.

### Changes Planned Based on Interview
<strong>Visualizations</strong>
- Review visualizations and make sure the labels are clear.
- Explore other platforms (infogram, unit charts, others) to vary the visualizations
<strong>Data and Content</strong>
- Add data or content on the effect of later start dates on total sleep and health (not just performance-related data).
- Add data or context on other potential causes for the decrease in high school sleep.
- Make the call to action more compelling
<strong>Overall</strong>
- Find a color scheme that is related to sleep and apply it to the project
- Add images or iconography that supports the story being told.
