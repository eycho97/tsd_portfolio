# Final Project: Part 2

## Wireframe
I used storyboard to develop my wireframe, and the link can be found here: [Storyboard Wireframe](https://preview.shorthand.com/fQ3Cofl65tsBUXhS)

## User Research and Interviews

| Question | Tech Professional, Female, 30s | Grad Student, Male, 20s | College Grad, Female 20s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What are your main takeaway(s) from this piece? | More sleep is better, trying to argue that later start times would help with that. However, it doesn’t feel like enough (telling the story the way you want it to be told). What are the other causes of not sleeping enough? (problem with the premise) | I need more sleep, and school needs to start later. Sleep is more important than I thought and I need more sleep. | More beneficial for students to start school later. It’s good to have a healthy sleep schedule. |
| Is there anything surprising or confusing? | Not really - data sources start consistent but become varied as it gets closer to the solution
Surprised it took time to go under the average | Surprised about that having less sleep leads to injury risk behavior specifically. Could be common sense but surprised to see the statistics. | Interested and surprised by the data - specifically the last two visualizations that show improvement after starting late. A little skeptical - other variables? Was sleep the only factor? |
| What additional information would you like to see? | What would the attacks to your study be, how would you combat or disprove those? Does later start time correlate to more sleep? Does it help with other behaviors? | Data that directly shows school that start later result in student sleep increasing | Sample size for solution, context into the institutions that carried out research (summary of experiment). Add academic-related data visualization in lack of sleep. |
| How did the story flow? Would you reorder any of the sections? | Flow is fine - need to add in sections around your approach (methodologies and approach, why are students not sleeping enough?, alternatives, details of experiment) | Introduction - for a more persuasive narrative could be removed (distracts from the story - unless I can communicate GPA in relation) | Like how you started with personal story, but too casual. Mention source of data (device) |
| Are the data visualizations clear? If not, what would you change? | Recommend sleep (how much they are getting vs. recommended)
Insufficient sleep (confusing)
Absences (pretty clear) | Very clear. PA sleep graph needs more comparison points. | Recommended hour of sleep graph (make x axis label (age range) more visible, Why is it important to show all the other age ranges?) 

Transition - too forced.

Diversify graph formats if possible |
| Who do you think the intended audience is | General population - educational, until you get to the call to help section.  | Could be a pamphlet for policy makers, teacher union | Policy makers, general public |
