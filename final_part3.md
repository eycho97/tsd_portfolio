## Summary of Changes
The following section addresses the changes I have made according to the plan I have made in [Part 2](/final_part2.md)

### Content
To address the feedback of wanting more context of the lack of sleep in high school students, I did additional research to explore the biological and social (use of smartphones and social media) to give the audiences a more complete picture. I believe this helped the strength of my narrative significantly, as the project seemed to have blamed early school start times as the main reason for the lack of sleep. 
I also added another study to my solution section on decreasing car crashes after delaying school start times. Before adding this study, the examples I looked at explored the affect on GPA and attendance, which are both important factors. However, they are not as important as the safety of students, so the newly added study serves as a resolution with a greater impact.

### Visualizations
To address the issue of readability some of my interviewees had, I made adjustements to make the color of the labels black instead of grey. Even though it was a small change, I believe it will have a great impact of the viewer's ability to understand the data. 
I also tried to add some variation to the visualizations. I initially had only bar graphs and line graphs, which were the most straight to the point. However, I tried to add some variation using unit charts and iconography. I am happy with the new visualizations as they add another dimension to help the viewers understand the data.

### Call to Action (Audience Consideration)
My target audience as identified in [Part 2](/final_part2.md), include high school students, parents, and school administrators. Therefore, I wanted to provide calls to action that address both long-term and immediate needs. One call to action is an example petition to delay school start times in Pittsburgh. By using this example, I hope parents will reach out to local school districts to start similar conversations, and for school administrators to start considering making changes as well. Additionally, I added a list of tips and resources to address the sleep hygiene needs for students and any other viewers who might be struggling with sleep. I hope the four tips and resource gives them a starting point to a journey for better sleep.

### Design Decisions
To make the website more cohesive, I tried to implement a color scheme for the background and highlight colors using this [calm color palette](https://www.schemecolor.com/keep-calm.php). I paired this with similarly-toned or grey background images to fit the overall aesthetic. Although most of the background colors with summarizing text uses a blue background, I tried to change the mood and use a pink background before the call to action section, to give the audience a sense of change for the better.
